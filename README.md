# BasicWarp
A basic Spigot warp plugin

Permissions:
- basicwarp.warp (Allow user to use the warp functionality)
- basicwarp.admin (Allow user to mess with other people's warps)
- basicwarp.limit.x (Maximum of warps that can be created (default is infinite))
- basicwarp.delay.x (Delay before the teleport, cancelled if player move or is attacked. If not set, no delay)

Commands:
 - /warp set <name> [player]
 - /warp delete <name> [player]
 - /warp go <name> [player]
 - /warp list [player]
 - /go <name> [player] (alias /g)


Well what else do you expect? It's in the name.

This was coded in ~2 hours so not the best plugin.
